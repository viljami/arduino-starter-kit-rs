Exercises of Arduino Starter Kit written in Rust.

Chapters

1. Setting Up
    * Includes instructions to setup the development environment

## Debugging

Later on it might be useful to be able to profile the applications. The quick way is starting with `flamegraph` and reading the article: [Profiling Rust programs the easy way](https://ntietz.com/blog/profiling-rust-programs-the-easy-way/).

```sh
# Install
cargo install flamegraph

# Run
cargo flamegraph
```
